A practise project, to work with attaching properties to exposed QQuickItems


Explenation:
For creating a attached property, you need 3 things:
    - The attachee (Any item something should be attached to)
    - The attached object (The object which actually is getting attached)
    - The attacher (An extra object which just defines 1 method to attach the object)
